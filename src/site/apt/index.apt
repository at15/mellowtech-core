Overview

  Mellowtech Core is a set of components that we use for working with disc based
  and byte based manipulation of Objects. It is typically useful for any scenario
  that involves

  * a need for storing your collections on disc

  * sorting large collections of objects that will not fit in memory

  * consistent access to files that contains objects

  * fast transformation of objects from and to byte representations (instead of using normal
  Java Serialization)

  []

  In our own work we have used this library mainly for developing search engines.

  The library itself was initially created by <Martin Svensson> and <Rickard CÃ¶ster> while
  working at the Swedish Institue of Computer Science in 2002. Since then it has undergone
  a lot of changes and enhancements and is now maintained and developed by mellowtech.org.
